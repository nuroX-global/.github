## About nuroX

nuroX builds closed-loop, zero-trust platforms that learn in production, turning telemetry into measurable lift and emitting compliance by design—linking research to real-world outcomes in mission-critical environments.

We fuse informatics, management cybernetics, enterprise architecture, and zero-trust security to create self-improving platforms that sense, decide, act, and learn. Every action logs evidence, every loop improves outcomes—MTTR down, SLO up, risk reduced.

## Vision

Unite informatics, cybernetics, and zero-trust engineering with quantified processes to create closed-loop deployable platforms that learn, heal, and win lift—making system resilience and compliance properties of the system and gamifying mission-critical work while pushing the state of the art.

## Mission

Engineer emergence: fuse informatics, management cybernetics, enterprise architecture, and zero-trust security to build self-improving, closed-loop platforms (sense → decide → act → learn) that gamify mission-critical systems, operationalize resilience, and turn telemetry into measurable business lift—while pushing the state of the art through security-led, applied research that moves from lab to production.

## Core Principles

### Closed Loops, Open Results
Platforms sense → decide → act → learn with audit trails; outcomes visible in KPIs (MTTR↓, SLO↑, cost/incident↓).

### Zero-Trust, Operationalized
Identity, least-privilege, signed artifacts, attested deployments. Compliance is emitted as by-product evidence.

### Telemetry → Lift
Data becomes actionable control signals; every loop ties back to a measurable business objective.

### Mission-Critical by Design
Built for rail, aviation, and defense-grade operations where failure is expensive.

### Research to Production
Security-led, applied research integrated into delivery; ideas don't stall in the lab.

### Gamified Adoption
Make the right behaviors the easy, rewarding path; adoption generates compounding value.

## Organization Defaults

This repository contains organization-wide defaults that are automatically applied to all new repositories in the nuroX organization:

### Auto-Validation Workflows
- **Automatic GitHub Action validation** for repositories containing GitHub Actions
- **Smart detection** - only validates repositories with "action" in name + action.yml file
- **nuroX standards enforcement** - ensures compliance with organizational standards
- **Zero configuration** - works automatically for developers
